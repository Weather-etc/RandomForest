# RandomForest
Random Forest: a C++ implementation, use Titanic dataset from Kaggle to verify its correctness and effectiveness. Referring to "Random Forest" by Leo Breiman, 2001.
## A complete README is ongoing...
This is my project of the class "Introduction to Algorithms" and a simple report is available. The report is mainly in Chinese (some words in Englis)
cuz my English is poor. (Definitions, theorems and proofs are according to L. Breiman's paper and I refer them at the end of my report)
This is rough and not totally completed. You may find its performance in real dataset is not good(actually, bad), but I argue that it works well to some points.
It gains robutness and stability as you increasing the number of trees in forest and this is the MOST IMPORTANT reason why Random Forest is popular for so 
many years. My object is to verify this characteristic but not obtain a high score on Titanic dataset - this does not make sense cuz there are already people who 
have 1.00 score on it.
